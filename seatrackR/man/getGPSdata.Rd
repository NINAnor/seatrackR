\usage{
getGPSdata(
  species = NULL,
  colony = NULL,
  dataResponsible = NULL,
  year = NULL,
  sessionId = NULL,
  individId = NULL,
  loadGeometries = F,
  loadLastUpdated = T,
  asTibble = T,
  limit = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{Character string. Option to limit selection to one or a set of species.Default is NULL, indicating all species.
The available choices can be seen in the column \code{species_name_eng} in the result from the function \code{getSpecies()}.}

\item{colony}{Character string. Option to limit selection to one or a set of colonies. Default is NULL. The available
choices can be seen in the column \code{colony_int_name} in the result from the function \code{getColonies()}.}

\item{dataResponsible}{Character string. Option to limit selection to one or a set of names of data responsible persons. Note that this
must conform to the name nomenclature used in the postable. Default is NULL. The available
choices can be seen in the column \code{name} in the result from the function \code{getNames()}.}

\item{year}{Character string. Option to limit selection to one or more years that the logging sessions span. The availablle
choices can be found in the \code{year_tracked} column in the result form the \code{getYears} function.}

\item{loadGeometries}{True, False. Should geometries be loaded from the columns lon_smooth2 and lat_smooth2?
If True, the returned object is a simple features object with only rows of eqfilter3 == 1, and with lat_smooth2 and lon_smooth2 values. Default = False}

\item{asTibble}{Boolean. Should the result be given as a tibble instead of a lazy query? Tibble is slower, but also here forces the timezone to "UTC".}

\item{limit}{FALSE or Integer. Limit the number of rows returned to this number. Default = False.}

\item{ringnumber}{Character string. Option to limit selection to one or a set of ring numbers. Default is NULL.}

\item{loadImportDate}{Boolean. Should results include the import date to the database? Default = True.}
}
\value{
A lazy query or optionally a tibble of postable records. In the case of loadGeometries = T (default), also of class sf (simple feature) with geometries based on lat lon.
